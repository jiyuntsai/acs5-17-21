ACS 5-Year Estimates data project for SF Standard

This is a repo for getting data from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey with their latest 5-year estimates data. For this project, we filtered geography on San Francisco in county level and in cenesus tract level.

Part one: sf profile on selected topics
This is a timely project when the data was embargoed before 0:00am, Dec. 8, 2022, therefore the data (tables) were directly downloaded from the Census Bureau and imported to R for further analysis.
